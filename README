NAME
    Test::EOL - Check the correct line endings in your project

SYNOPSIS
    "Test::EOL" lets you check the presence of windows line endings in your
    perl code. It report its results in standard "Test::Simple" fashion:

      use Test::EOL tests => 1;
      eol_unix_ok( 'lib/Module.pm', 'Module is ^M free');

    Module authors can include the following in a t/eol.t and have
    "Test::EOL" automatically find and check all perl files in a module
    distribution:

      use Test::EOL;
      all_perl_files_ok();

    or

      use Test::EOL;
      all_perl_files_ok( @mydirs );

DESCRIPTION
    This module scans your project/distribution for any perl files (scripts,
    modules, etc) for the presence of windows line endings.

EXPORT
    A list of functions that can be exported. You can delete this section if
    you don't export anything, such as for a purely object-oriented module.

FUNCTIONS
  all_perl_files_ok( [ @directories ] )
    Applies "eol_unix_ok()" to all perl files found in @directories (and sub
    directories). If no <@directories> is given, the starting point is one
    level above the current running script, that should cover all the files
    of a typical CPAN distribution. A perl file is *.pl or *.pm or *.t or a
    file starting with "#!...perl"

    If the test plan is defined:

      use Test::EOL tests => 3;
      all_perl_files_ok();

    the total number of files tested must be specified.

  eol_unix_ok( $file [, $text] )
    Run a unix EOL check on $file. For a module, the path (lib/My/Module.pm)
    or the name (My::Module) can be both used.

BUGS
    Testing for EOL styles other than unix (\n) currently unsupported.
